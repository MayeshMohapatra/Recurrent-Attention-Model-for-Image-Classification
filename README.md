# Recurrent Attention Model for Image Classification

Implementation of the Recurrent Attention Model for Image Classification


## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Recurrent Attention Model, which processes images by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions to attend to. The model uses:

- **Glimpse Sensor**: Extracts retina-like multi-resolution patches from images
- **Glimpse Network**: Processes glimpse patches and location coordinates
- **Core Network**: RNN that maintains internal state (simple RNN for classification)
- **Location Network**: Outputs next location to attend to (trained with REINFORCE)
- **Action Network**: Outputs classification/action decisions (trained with supervised learning for classification)
- **Value Network**: Estimates expected cumulative reward for variance reduction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blebot0/Recurrent-Attention-Model-for-Image-Classification.git
cd Recurrent-Attention-Model-for-Image-Classification
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training on MNIST

Train on standard MNIST:
```bash
python scripts/train_mnist.py --dataset mnist --num_glimpses 6 --num_epochs 10
```

### Model Checkpoints

During training, the model automatically saves checkpoints to `./checkpoints/` (or custom directory via `--save_dir`):
- `{dataset}_best.pth`: Best performing model (highest test accuracy)
- `{dataset}_latest.pth`: Most recent epoch

Each checkpoint contains:
- Model weights (`model_state_dict`)
- Optimizer state (`optimizer_state_dict`)
- Training configuration
- Epoch number and test accuracy

Custom save directory:
```bash
python scripts/train_mnist.py --save_dir ./my_models
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path ./checkpoints/mnist_best.pth --dataset mnist
```
